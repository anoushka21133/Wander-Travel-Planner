# Wander-Travel-Planner
The application is developed to be an assistance for planning travels according to user preferences such as temperature, precipitation and landforms. Currently the application focuses on USA only, however with provision of data for other continents it can be easily extended. 
The GUI of application is developed using Tkinter widgets.
Plotting of maps of USA for depicting information is done by using plotly library graph objects Choropleth. The maps show relevant information on mouse hover. The data to be plotted by these maps is provided in the form of csv files.
Panda library is used for reading information from csv files. Data in csv files is prepared by referring to information from internet.
We have also added ‘search history’,’wishlist’ and user login features to incorporate mysql and python interfacing in our project. The login helps the user to create an account with an appropriate username and password and thus save material, revisit old searches and create wishlists. All of this is done by creating tables in sql and adding data to them.
